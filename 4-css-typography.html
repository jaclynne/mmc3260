            <h2> Oh hey there! </h2>
            <p>My name is Jo-Anne and I'm a student at the University of Florida. I'm majoring in journalism            and with a focus in online media. I love writing and I love the internet so I figured, why not                      put the two together? </p>
        
        <p>Ever since I could remember, I’ve always loved reading and writing. I would make up stories about            animals or people who got sucked into distant lands. As I grew, so did my stories. Now instead of                           one or two page stories, I’m currently in the middle of writing a book.</p>
                
        <p>I enjoy journalistic writing as well. It’s always interesting to see what happened to who and                when. What people think or have to say about a certain topic or idea has always interested me. 
        Like I said before, I really love the internet. There are just so many things that people can               connect with one another because of the internet. </p>
                
        <p>If I could combine writing stories for readers and working on the internet, that would make me               happy. </p>
